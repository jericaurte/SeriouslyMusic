# SeriouslyMusic
Capstone project for Database Systems course to analyze and begin creation of the database needed for a new music information service.

Seriously! Music® is a new music information service under development. While other companies sell music in various forms and media, Seriously! Music® seeks to be the one source users will turn to when they want in-depth information about songs, artists, musicians, genres, and other aspects of music. Specifically, the company would like you to create the segment of its database that deals with songs, albums, artists, musicians, genres, and record companies.

The company wants a variety of information, starting first and foremost with the songs (or music pieces). The company also wants to track the artists singing the songs (or
playing the music piece). An artist may be a group of individual musicians or might be a single musician with respect to a song. (For example, Eric Clapton is a musician and artist in his own right but was also a member of the artist groups Cream and the Yardbirds.)

A song or work may or may not be classified into a one genre but a given song might appear in more than one genre (e.g., blues and alternative music). A song may or may not be part of a larger collection of songs (album), and might or might not be associated with a recording label (record company). A song may appear on more than one album (e.g., on an original album and then on a "Greatest Hits" album). And although an album is connected to at least one artist, it is possible for an album to be associated with multiple artists (e.g., "Greatest Hits of the 1990s").
